# Dice Model
### Background
This assignment required me to create a dice model by implementing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) software design pattern, integrating user input, as well as displaying a histogram for a significant amount of dice rolls for each dice (as specified by the user) and relevant information regarding each simulated dice and the simulated collection of all dices. Additionally, error-checking for input values is applied.

The user is asked to input the number of dice and the number of sides per dice, and each of these dices are added to a DiceCollection. Then, the user can choose to roll each dice one time, or 100,000 times which would display a histogram comparing the total of all the numbers rolled per die, or to quit the program.
